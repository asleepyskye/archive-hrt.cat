# Laminar Flow Hoods

_Updated Nov 22, 2023_

Flow hoods should be "Class 5 or better"[^1] to meet USP 797 standards. Good info about class 5 [here](https://www.ossila.com/en-us/pages/laminar-flow-hoods-iso-classification).

You can use H13 or H14 HEPA filters to achieve Class 5 cleanliness[^2][^3] (assuming you're using a well made flow hood)

Assuming you're using a well made hood, you should be able to use a standard mycology flow hood for your brew process. This will save you a substantial amount of money and will (in theory) acheive the same quality assuming you're using a H13 or H14 HEPA filter.

Videos about how to work inside of a flow hood:

- We recommend you go on youtube and search "laminar flow aseptic techinque" to learn more about how to use the hood.
