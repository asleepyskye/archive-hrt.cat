# Heat Sterilization

_Published Sept 2 2024_

{: .caution }
This step has not been written yet. We don't believe it's a strictly necessary step. Regardless, the extent of the info we have right now is placed here for people who might want it.


## Coming Soon!

There is so much controversy over this step. We see a lot of criticism for not having a final step of heat sterilization in our guide, and while we believe it's not strictly necessary, if done correctly it is another level of assurance. 

The problem, as we see it, is that we haven't been able to find a single set of instructions on how to do this properly. All homebrewers that talk about how to do this online are using incorrect temps and methods, and we have info all over the site demonstrating this. See the notes below.


## How to do it for now

We are in the process of researching this. We inject our medicine that has been filtered but has not been heated and we nor anyone we supply have had issues. A test vial that has sat in the sunlight for over a year does not show signs of bacterial growth. Regardless we are working on the research to add this step. Here's what we know so far:

* MCT oil has a smoke point of approx 320F. We can't find better data than cooking blogs for this, so use at your own discretion. 
* At 150C/302F, dry heat, a solution needs to sit for 150 minutes to properly sterilize. This does not include the amount of time it takes to get up to temperature. 
* The oven in your kitchen does not put off the same temperature consistently, it cycles up and down. It often has patches of lower/higher temps at various spots in the oven
* Consider 150 minutes a low estimate because of the above. 
* If you cook food in the oven you plant to use for this, it's normal for grease and oil to kick around when the oven gets hot. You should cover everything in aluminum foil to protect it from this.
* You CANNOT do this if you have plastic caps on your vials. You gotta use metal caps. We believe butyl rubber stoppers are safe at this temp.
* We see no point in doing this until the preparation is in the final vials, as you'll just have to expose it to air again when you dispense it. 

## Notes:

* [Sterilization Temps info](/topics/sterilization_temps)
* [Some of my notes on the subject](/journal#speaking-with-a-phd-chemist-about-our-method)
* [More notes](/journal#heating-finished-vials)
* [Ranting about how other people make HRT](/properly-sterilized). has some relevant info on how *not* to do things.
* You CANNOT autoclave a vial of HRT, it doesn't work. There has to be moisture in the vial, which we explicitly do not want for this. Further, autoclaves don't get hot enough for this. I feel like a crazy person every time I type this again. [Some disjointed notes on this](/lena).
