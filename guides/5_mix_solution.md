# Mix Solution

_Updated April 15, 2024_

{: .info }
We do not use a magnetic stirrer but that is an option instead of using a glass rod. Would be useful if making large batches. 

## Recipe

Choose a recipe to brew, there are many options listed [here].

You can also try out our [recipe calculator here]! This calculator is in beta, so please use it with caution. 

## Mixing

Doing this all inside your still air box or laminar flow hood. Using proper sanitization technique. 

Measure out all the ingredients into a depyrogenated beaker or media bottle. They do not need to be added in any specific order. Introduce a bowl of hot water to your work area, then submerge the beaker into the hot water, creatng a nice little bath. This heat will help the mixture fall into solution, but it's not so hot that we risk damaging the hormones or the oils. With the beaker in a hot water bath, mix everything up with a glass stirring rod until the hormone powder is fully dissolved. 

When we assemble our cleanroom we fill a large thermos with boiling water, so we don't have to boil water in the clean room. We then take a large bowl, pour some boiling water into it, and then submerge the beaker into the water while stirring. It massively speeds up the dissolving process.
