# Contribute

HRT Cat is an open source project hosted [here](https://git.gay/hrtcat/pages) on Git.Gay. The `dev` branch hosts the raw markdown/jekyll files while the `main` branch is just the build files. There is an automation that builds the `dev` branch and throws it on `main` when the `dev` branch is pushed/merged. Pull requests to add or correct information are encouraged. If you would like to take a larger role in the maintenance of the site please [contact us](/contact) directly.
