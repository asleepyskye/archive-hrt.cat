# Goodbye

The team that has managed HRT Cat has disbanded. We all continue to believe in how important trans bodily autonomy is, but our sights are now being set elsewhere. We are hopeful that the trans diy community will continue pushing forward in using high quality documentation and research to support DIY.

This site will stay online until it gets taken down or the domain expires, but it likely will not receive any further updates.

If we can leave you with one final piece of advice: please stop heating your HRT.

- [Make a final donation](/donate)

God bless you in these times.
